# DynamicForm

I often get a request how to collect data from external users using PowerPlatform. Of course, MS Forms immediately comes to mind. Sure, this makes it easy to create an impersonal & undynamic form and the user has to fill in all the information.

However, the problem is not with MS Forms per se, but with the fact that all access is anonymous. (only company internal users can be authenticated via login) furthermore only authenticated users can upload and submit files.

What can my proposed solution and what does it look like?
– This can display dynamic content
– Can identify & associate each form user and their input
– any user can upload files

The full description and how to use you could find <a href="https://lehmann.ws/2022/12/06/why-it-doesnt-need-ms-forms-and-how-powerautomate-can-actually-already-do-the-same-and-even-more/">here at my blogpost<a>.
